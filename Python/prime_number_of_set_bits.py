#  Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

# (Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)
